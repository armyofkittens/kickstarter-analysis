# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
After the kickstarter for Fever went live, it fell short of it's initial fundraising goal. The purpose of this analysis is to see if there was a more optimal Kickstarter launch date for a theater based production, or if my launch goal disuaded people from pledging to the campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

</p>
In the first quarter of the year the overall volume of kickstarters were lower, with January trending upwards but declining by March. In the second quarter we see the number of successful kickstarters skyrocket, but then continue to trend down through the third quarter. September seems to see a slight uptick in successful kickstarters however there is also a disproportionately large increase in failed kickstarters. The year ends with the lowest number of successful kickstarters. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

</p>
The results indicate that there is a lot of success with very low goals, and mid-to-high goals. The highest percentage of overall successes is in the "less than 1000" range" as well as the $35,000-$45,000 range. The sweet spot for failed goals is in the $25,000-$29,000 range as well as anything over $45,000. The mid to low range of $15,000-$20,000 indiate that there isn't a huge difference in that rage between failed and success. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
