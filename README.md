# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
After the kickstarter for Fever went live, it fell short of it's initial fundraising goal. The purpose of this analysis is to see if there was a more optimal Kickstarter launch date for a theater based production, or if my launch goal disuaded people from pledging to the campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
