# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
After the kickstarter for Fever went live, it fell short of it's initial fundraising goal. The purpose of this analysis is to see if there was a more optimal Kickstarter launch date for a theater based production, or if my launch goal disuaded people from pledging to the campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

</p>
A new "Year" column was created in order to extract the year from the kickstarter date creation, and then the entire database was imported into a PivotTable. The Year and Category was added as a filter to allow user manipulation, and then for the pupose of this analysis the Theater category was selected. The column was then set to outcomes and the rows were set to Kickstarter creation dates. Each cell contains the number of outcomes based on selected criteria and then sorted to show the number of successful kickstarter campaigns first. Data was moved into a line chart by using PivotChart.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
